title: Applying Photogrammetry to Library Collections
---
Through a collaborative effort with Digital Humanists, Carnegie Mellon University Libraries' Digitization Lab is expanding its services to integrate photogrammetry—a cost-effective method to render physical objects or structures into digital 3-D models. An emerging technology in libraries, photogrammetry offers an augmented approach to document and preserve three-dimensional objects and historical artifacts. This poster will demonstrate the steps that CMU Libraries’ Digitization Lab has taken to integrate 3-D rendering into its workflow and how we are preparing to offer this new digital service—including workshops in conjunction with Digital Humanities—to the greater campus community.
