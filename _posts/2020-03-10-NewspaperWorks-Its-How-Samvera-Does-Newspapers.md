title: NewspaperWorks&#58; It's How Samvera Does Newspapers
---
NewspaperWorks is a plugin for Samvera and Hyrax-based repository applications that provides custom ingest, management, and display functionality for digitized newspaper content. NewspaperWorks can be used to add newspapers to an existing repository, or to create a stand-alone bespoke newspaper content interface. This poster outlines the major features of this Rails engine, including automated ingest of NDNP batches and PDF issues; newspaper-specific metadata modules; full-text search and highlighting; calendar-based browsing; advanced search, and more.
