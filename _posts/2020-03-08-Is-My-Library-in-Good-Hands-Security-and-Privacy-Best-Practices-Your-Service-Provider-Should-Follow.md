title: Is My Library in Good Hands?&#58; Security and Privacy Best Practices Your Service Provider Should Follow
---
With small or non-existent IT departments, many libraries rely on service providers to install and manage software for their organizations, so that staff can focus their time and energy on patrons and day-to-day activities. But how can a library determine if their service provider is following best practices or if a provider's infrastructure is secure? What questions should organizations ask to determine what (if any) privacy and security standards a service provider follows and if they will align with the library's IT requirements?

Libraries should treat externally managed services like an extension of their library and never assume that service providers are automatically following best practices. This session will discuss some of the most important questions a library can ask a potential or current service provider. It is never to late to conduct due diligence and protect the integrity of your collections.
