title: Indexing Shared File Stores to Mine Folksonomy and Clear ROT
---
Shared folder structures, like those contained in network drives and cloud-based files stores, represent a rich -- and underutilized -- source of descriptive information. Since network drives and web collaboration tools are usually where shared folder structures are found, these structures can be considered effective folksonomies, as folder titles and organization in these spaces was likely "crowdsourced" from the team that uses them. Similarly, as shared file stores are frequently used as work areas for teams, these stores are very likely to house ROT (Redundant, Obsolete, Trivial) information. Both the underutilization of folder structures in shared file stores and the accumulation of information ROT are symptoms of file stores being used by teams for decades, but largely ignored by digital transformation and other organizational information strategy efforts.
Now, our team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is seeking to alleviate these issues by 1) parsing folder structure information, and 2) indexing the parsed file information so that it can be assessed from a single view to determine whether it should be retained or dispositioned. This poster will address the technical challenges of parsing folders and files using Apache Tika, and discuss assessment strategies enabled by the index. Overall, this poster seeks call information professionals' attention to these digital "junk drawers," so we may understand what value they can offer individuals and organizations after decades of accumulation and description without evaluation.
