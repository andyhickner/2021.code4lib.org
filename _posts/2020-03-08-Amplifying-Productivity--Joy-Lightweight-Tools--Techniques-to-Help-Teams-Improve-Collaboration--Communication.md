title: Amplifying Productivity & Joy&#58; Lightweight Tools & Techniques to Help Teams Improve Collaboration & Communication
---
In this presentation, we will share and discuss tools & techniques our team has used and developed over the past year to improve and streamline how we work together, how we communicate, and how we interface with management and stakeholders. Areas of focus include formalizing requests for work estimation; documenting architectural decisions; planning for maintenance; sharing current work progress and backlog/roadmap information; triaging production issues without disrupting project work; and recognizing each other's contributions and accomplishments. We acknowledge that teams are busy, so all techniques are lightweight, and none of them depend on one another; they are an a la carte menu.
