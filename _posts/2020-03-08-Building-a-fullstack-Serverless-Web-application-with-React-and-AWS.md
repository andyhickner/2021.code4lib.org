Serverless computing allows you to build Web applications without managing or maintaining servers. Using AWS, we can build and deploy responsive applications in the cloud with built-in high availability and flexible scaling capabilities.

In this workshop, we will learn how to build a full-stack serverless Web application using React and several AWS services, including AWS Amplify, Lambda, AppSync, DynamoDB, etc. Weâ€™ll start the workshop with a quick overview of serverless computing and AWS, followed by creating a React application, integrating with AWS managed services and deploying this application in AWS.

Workshop Agenda:
Introduction to AWS, Serverless, AWS Amplify, and React
Section 1: Create your first React application and setup AWS Amplify
Section 2: Setup access controls for your application
Section 3: Introduction to GraphQL and AWS AppSync
Section 4: Perform data mutations for your application
Section 5: Introduction to multiple development environments
