title: Picturing the Digitization Ecosystem
---
Digital Research and Strategy at the New York Public Library would like to present a new project that leverages available statistical information in our various databases to tell a holistic narrative about the digitization lifecycle. Making use of SQL databases, Python, and R, our interface tracks the digitization lifecycle from the creation of a metadata record to digital objects ingested into the repository to rights statement assignment to approval and online publishing. Each stage of the lifecycle had previously been reported separately by individual departments but had never been pulled together into a single snapshot despite the ways each part of the story informs the other. Our goal is to create a comprehensive view into the intertwined processes that constitute the digitization story to help stakeholders better understand the invisible work required to bring digital assets online and provide useful data for strategic decision-making and funding.
