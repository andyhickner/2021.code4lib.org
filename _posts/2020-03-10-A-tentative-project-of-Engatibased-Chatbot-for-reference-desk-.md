title: A tentative project of Engati-based Chatbot for reference desk. 
---
Along with the development of Artificial Intelligence, AI, technology, chatbots have been increasingly used in the library space. Along with the increasing research literature regarding the potential of AI technology in improving customer services, chatbot has been widely used in answering simple questions and greeting to patrons in practice in recent years. However, the potential of this technology in reference service has rarely been discussed. In this poster, we plan to display the outcome of our research on building a tentative reference services chatbot on the basis of the chatbot platform Engati. The outcome of our research still shows the potential of AI technology in assisting reference librarian with their everyday work.
