The presenters will outline efforts to create a unified discovery platform for digital collections from libraries, archives, and museums. They will guide attendees through the process of designing harmonized metadata profiles for these related but very different domains, including solutions for conciliating controlled vocabularies. They will discuss the software stack's approach to moving the harmonized data from varied back-end systems to a singular point from which they build out multiple sites leveraging cloud services and open source technologies. Overall, presenters will describe a comprehensive plan for unifying diverse digital collections to allow for serendipitous discovery of cultural heritage collections.
