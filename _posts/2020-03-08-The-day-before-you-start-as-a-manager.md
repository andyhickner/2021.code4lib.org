title: The Day Before You Start as a Manager
---
Transitioning to management can be stressful. You've likely done a really great job as an individual contributor, so now you'll stop doing that and do something else instead - management. If you're used to being a high performer, the absolute cluelessness you feel as a new manager can be particularly nasty. There are tons of books and trainings out there, but you don't even know what you don't know, and most training material is geared towards the corporate world anyway. In this talk, I'll run through a few key lessons learned and things I wish I had known the day before I started as a manager in a library environment.
