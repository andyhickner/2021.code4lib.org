title: What's a Microfilm? Proper Digital Archiving for Theses and Dissertations
---
Many universities still rely on paper or microfilming of theses and dissertations as a record of scholarly output despite the challenges that brings with embargoes and the capture of additional media types such as data sets, time-lapse photography, etc. Even with a properly proportioned institutional repository, are these unique files properly preserved and described? In this case study, one university attempts to tackle those issues and rid themselves of the burden of paper-pushing and microfilming towards a fully digital workflow for proper preservation of these unique materials.
