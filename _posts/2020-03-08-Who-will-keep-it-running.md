A migration project that does not take into consideration the people and resources necessary to maintain the system post-migration is incomplete. But the people making decisions about migrations are not necessarily the same people that will be responsible for maintenance. How can we best involve, value, and consider the perspective of staff responsible for maintenance in our migration projects? If a migration is the "shiny object",  how do we equally prepare for the (hopefully) much longer period of maintenance that will come after? This talk will reflect on lessons learned from multiple migration projects and how the plans for future maintainability did or did not work out.
