Join our DevOps team from Princeton for a one-day, hands-on workshop. Youâ€™ll get a comprehensive overview of Ansible and then dive into an overview of creating roles to manage your infrastructure and/or applications. You will be equipped with the skills to take this back to your organization and implement right away.
