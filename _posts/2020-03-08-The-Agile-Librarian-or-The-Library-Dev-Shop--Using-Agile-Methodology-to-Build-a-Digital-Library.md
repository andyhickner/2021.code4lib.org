title: The Agile Librarian or The Library Dev Shop - Using Agile Methodology to Build a Digital Library
---
At UCLA we are building our digital library using Agile methodologies. We use quick iterative sprints, work towards a minimum viable product and continuously deploy as we build. This is a switch from the waterfall building techniques that resulted in many unfinished projects and long waits for simple changes. I will discuss the Agile tools and methods our teams uses, including sprint planning, retrospectives, pair programming, and test driven development. I will also discuss the benefits of Agile project management and the success we have experienced through using these tools.
