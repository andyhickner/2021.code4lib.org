title: Surviving a post-developer wasteland
---
When the entire web application development team of 2 left UNCW Randall Libraryâ€™s IT department at the same time to pursue employment in the corporate world, we were faced with the dilemma of how to support a complex and recently expanded set of technologies. These included 50+ applications and websites, a newly created Docker/Rancher containerization structure and gitlab versioning workflow to manage. This poster illustrates how we maintained continuity of business through intensive cross training, planning, and building on the culture of documentation that our department already had in place.
