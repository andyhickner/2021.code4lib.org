title: Let’s Talk About Contingent Labor
---
Are you on your third 3-year project to build the next big thing in libraries? Did you get hired to start a digital archiving program in 2 years with contract renewal up in the air? Contingent labor in libraries looks like a lot of things, from contracting developers to grant projects to strategic term positions to grad student work to interns. In 2019, the [Collective Responsibility Forum](https://laborforum.diglib.org) brought together one group of workers to talk about their experiences of contingency and its impacts. We wrote recommendations for building better grants. Now, we’re building networks and tools to continue the conversation with other workers across the LAM spectrum. We’ll bring materials to share but, more importantly, we want to talk with you!
