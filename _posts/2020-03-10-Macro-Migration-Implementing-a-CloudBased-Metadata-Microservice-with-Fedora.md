title: Macro Migration&#58; Implementing a Cloud-Based Metadata Microservice with Fedora
---
This poster illustrates a Fedora-based metadata microservice that utilizes Amazon Web Services (AWS) and other cloud-based products for indexing, storing Resource Description Framework triples and files, and managing Docker containers, demonstrated in a beta implementation of a publication metadata discovery layer. When embarking upon the 10-month project to develop a new administrative and discovery platform for the publication metadata, we prioritized the use of open source software, linked open data, widely adopted metadata standards, and interoperability with local systems. After exploring existing Fedora-based frameworks, we found that forcing those, such as Samvera or Islandora, imposed challenges that could be mitigated if building a custom application that is interoperable with our existing architecture. We capitalized upon the migration of the publication metadata system to improve performance and reduce redundancy across other information resources, including a digital library, a publications content management system (CMS), and a research information system (RIS). With objectives toward standardization, openness, and cloud native environments, we modeled a Fedora-based metadata microservice that employs cloud-based environments for storing and indexing metadata, running Docker, and managing the continuous integration pipeline.
