title: Advancing Hyku&#58; improving institutional repositories for Green Open Access
---
Advancing Hyku is collaborative project to support the growth of open access through institutional repositories, by introducing significant structural improvements and new features to the Samvera Community's open source Hyku platform. The project partners are University of Virginia Library, Ubiquity Press and the British Library, with funding from Arcadia, a charitable fund of philanthropists Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin. The project runs October 2019-August 2021. This poster will detail the features being developed for auto-population, visualization, annotation, author profiling, metrics and long-term preservation. It will also solicit community feedback on working prototypes.
