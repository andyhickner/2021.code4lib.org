title: Testing the Usability, Scalability, & Accessibility of a Small-Scale Application 
---
Numerous library Software as a Service (SaaS) vendors have developed products with API access to facilitate data views and data management. Subsequently, the vendor customers working with this API data create graphical user interface (GUI) applications for ease of use by non-coders. This poster will document through the use of a flowchart the process of creating a derivative application for a single institution’s needs, scaling the application for outside institutions' use, and conducting user testing for the application and the application’s deployment materials. Successes, wrong turns, and failures in attempts to meet accessibility, usability, and scalability goals will be revealed. The resulting product is a scalable application posted on GitHub that includes deployment learning modules for non-coders.
