title: Accessing web archives with Internet Archive & Archive-It APIs
---
This workshop will introduce participants to tools for using web archives, with a particular focus on tools to facilitate access to web archives. Using real life use cases, Web Archivists from the Internet Archive will demonstrate Internet Archive and Archive-It APIs and integrations for use in creating access points to web archives, organizing and moving files, facilitating full-text search, and sharing metadata. Participants will work directly with the tools, as well as related code and file formats, in this half-day, hands-on workshop. The day will also include time for introduction to web archives and their technologies for beginners, and feedback on further developing these web archiving APIs going forward. By the end of the day, participants will be able to identify and interact with web archive APIs, with concrete ideas for future custom implementation at their libraries. All skill levels are welcome, but a base understanding of web conventions is necessary to get the most out of this workshop.
