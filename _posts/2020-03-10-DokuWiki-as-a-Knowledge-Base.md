title: DokuWiki as a Knowledge Base
---
This poster walks through using DokuWiki with the Active Directory plugin to give different groups of library staff access to technical support (FAQs) for computers, printers, and software. It also serves as a knowledge base for IT staff to manage and coordinate processes involving the ILS, SQL Server, Task Manager, and custom python scripts.
