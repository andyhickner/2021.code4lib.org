How does one enhance access to historical data through mapping and visualization tools? In this presentation, the experience of working with over 21 thousand historical records from the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's school admission registers will be discussed. In particular, the normalizing of historical occupational data using hand coding, OpenRefine, and Tableau will be examined. How many gentlewomen were there in Philadelphia? Where did their children attend school, and did the children of tinmen go there, too? And what, exactly, is a shrimp fiend? Learn the answers to these questions, as well as lessons from this second-year LEADS-4-NDP Fellowship project, in this humorous and informative presentation.
