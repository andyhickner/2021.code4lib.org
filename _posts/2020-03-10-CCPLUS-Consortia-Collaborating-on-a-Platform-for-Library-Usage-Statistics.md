title: CC-PLUS&#58; Consortia Collaborating on a Platform for Library Usage Statistics
---
CC-PLUS is an open source software platform that provides libraries and consortia with a usage statistics tool to support data-driven stewardship decisions. Using the SUSHI protocol, CC-PLUS harvests COUNTER-compliant reports from multiple vendors into a single shared database. Reports are harvested automatically on a schedule determined by each institution, then they're verified and combined to allow for customized report outputs. Multiple consortia have come together to design special features to support consortial workflows and sharing within the platform. These allow for both single library and shared consortial administration of the final product. CC-PLUS is created using the open-source Laravel framework and will be available with an Apache software license. This project was funded in-part by IMLS.
