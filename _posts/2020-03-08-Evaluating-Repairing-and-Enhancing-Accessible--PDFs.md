title: Evaluating, Repairing and Enhancing Accessible  PDF's
---
Making our websites accessible is a struggle we see everyday, in every corner of the internet. As a community, we have all been working hard to alleviate stress when it comes to navigating the web, but a lot of the time, we forget about making PDFs accessible! Many of the same principles from web accessibility carry over into PDFs, but successfully implementing and testing these principles is where many need guidance. In this talk, we will go over how to create, evaluate, repair and enhance documents using Microsoft Word, as well as Adobe Acrobat pro, and make them suitable for all users on the web.
