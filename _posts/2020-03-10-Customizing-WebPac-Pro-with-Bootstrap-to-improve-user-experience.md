title: Customizing WebPac Pro with Bootstrap to improve user experience
---
The most current build of Innovativeâ€™s WebPAC Pro OPAC lacks responsive features, which makes it very difficult to navigate on mobile and tablet. By integrating the open source Bootstrap front-end framework, WebPac pro can be customized to be fully responsive and mobile friendly. This poster highlights how WebPac Pro can be customized, the steps developers should take to identify areas for improvement, and a brief overview of the process of integrating bootstrap into the existing structure.
