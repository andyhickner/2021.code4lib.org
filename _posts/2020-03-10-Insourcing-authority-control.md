title: Insourcing authority control
---
Access and discovery of library resources in the catalog depends on consistent, authorized access points. Some libraries turn to outside vendors to provide automated authority control, but this can be too expensive for many. This poster explains some simple tricks that even the coding-challenged can use to begin in-sourcing automated authority control using SQL queries and regular expressions to process reports from Innovative Sierra and SirsiDynix Symphony and retrieve matching authority records with OCLC Connexion Client.
