title: Design Sprints for Democratization
---
The collective intelligence of teams improves when everyone can contribute. Unfortunately, factors like impostor syndrome, Dunning-Kruger syndrome, and organizational power structures can prevent some voices being heard. Design Sprints provide a decision making framework in which the team can work together toward finding the best solution instead of deferring to the loudest voices. Design Sprints can also strengthen and democratize the products built by software teams. This talk will cover design sprint structure, report on a real world example, and describe how this technique can be incorporated into an agile project plan to align the teamâ€™s vision of what will be produced and why.
