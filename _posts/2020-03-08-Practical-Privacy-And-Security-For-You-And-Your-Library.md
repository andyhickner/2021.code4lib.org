We all know we should use good passwords, keep our things updated, and follow other basic precautions
while online; however, understanding the reasons behind these rules is critical to help us convince
ourselves and others that the extra work is indeed worth it. This session will cover securing you & your
library. Keeping your data, network, website, and computers safe and private. We'll talk about some security
myths, passwords, tracking, malware, and will cover a range of tools and techniques that everyone can do to improve their digital lives.
